# STAT 545 - Homework 1

This repository contains my first homework assignment for the R course [STATS 545](http://stat545.com). A description of the assignment can be found [here][(ttp://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw01/hw01.html) and important information about the course can be found in the [course classroom](http://stat545.com/Classroom/).

**Navigating through `hw01-slumnitz`**:

This repository includes:
1. learn more about myself
    * Who am I?
    * Why am I doing this course?
2. How to explore a dataset with R?
    * exploring a dataset in `.Rmd`
    * generating an `.md` file


## Who am I?

Welcome to my repository! :tada:

![me](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/35147471?s=400&u=fe6bcd345611473a90b006c3b41396cd47cf9deb&v=4)

My name is Stefanie. I am a MSc. student at the *Faculty of Forestry*, but more importantly I am an absolute data science nerd and an [open source software programmer](http://pysal.org/team.html) for the [Python Spatial Analysis Library](https://github.com/pysal) (PySAL). Plus the more of my research I can automate, the more I can enjoy the outdoors around Vancouver. Leaving my desk going to the :mountains:.


## Why am I doing this course?

Since I have heard the rumor that R is more powerful for statistical data analysis than Python, I decided to go and check it out myself. Reading more about R I would especially like to learn:
- [ ] how to code in R, especially how to use:
    - [ ] the "tidyverse" package 
    - [ ] the "ggplot2" package
    - [ ] and "shiny" for web-based applications

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("shiny")
```

- [ ] how to use R Studio
- [x] how to use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
- [ ] about the principle of ['tidy data'](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)
- [ ] about the concept of ['pipes'](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial)
- [ ] how to apply the concept of ['grammar of graphics'](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/visualize/ggplot2.html)
- [x] <del>change to the dark R site from the bright Python side</del>


## Adventures in exploring a dataset with R:
